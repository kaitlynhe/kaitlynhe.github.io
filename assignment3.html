          <h1>Assignment 3: Input! Output!</h1>
          <p>
          Here is all the documentation for Assignment 3!
          <h3>The Schematic</h3>
          <img src= "ass3-schematic.jpg" alt= "Picture of the schematic I drew" width=400></a>
          This drawing is the schematic of a potentiometer and two LED lights.
          Resisters are picked from assignment 1 and suggested in class, and with calculation shown in the picture.

          <h3>The Circuit</h3>
          <img src= "ass3-circuit.JPG" alt= "Picture of the Circuit I created" width=400></a>
          This is the final set up for the circuit looping from pin9, pin10, 5V to GND.

          <h3>The Code</h3>
          <pre>
            //This is a code that allows one Potentiometer controls two LED lights bright or dim at the same time.

            //these constans won't change. They are names of the input and output pins.
            const int analogInPin = A0;   //analog input pin that the potentiometer is attached to
            const int analogOutPin1 = 9;  //analog output pin that the yellow LED light is attached to
            const int analogOutPin2 = 8;  //analog output pin that the white LED light is attached to


            int sensorValue = 0;    //value read from the pot
            int outputValue = 0;    //value output to the PWM


            void setup() {
              // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
              Serial.begin(9600);

            }


            void loop() {
              // read the analog in values
              sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);
              //map it to the range of the analog out put
              outputValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 800, 0, 255);
              //change the analog out value for the yellow and white LED lights
              analogWrite(analogOutPin1, outputValue);
              analogWrite(analogOutPin2, outputValue);

              //print out the result to the Serial Monitor
              Serial.print("sensor = ");
              Serial.print(sensorValue);
              Serial.print("\t output = ");
              Serial.println(outputValue);

              //wait 50 ms before the next loop begins so that the result is more obvious
              delay(50);


            }
          </pre>

          <h3>The Operation of the Circuit</h3>
          Below is a short demo of the circuit in operation.
