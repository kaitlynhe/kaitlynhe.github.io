          <h1>Assignment 2: Fade!</h1>
          <p>
          Here is all the documentation for Assignment 1!
          <h3>The Schematic</h3>
          <img src= "schematicpic.JPG" alt= "Picture of the schematic I drew" width=400></a>
          This drawing is the schematic of a RGB light and a button.
          Resisters are picked from assignment 1 and suggested in class.

          <h3>The Circuit</h3>
          <img src= "ass2-circuit.JPG" alt= "Picture of the Circuit I created" width=400></a>
          This is the final set up for the circuit looping from pin9, pin10, pin11 to GND.

          <h3>The Code</h3>
          <pre>
            //This allows one to press the button to trigger the RGB LED Light.
            //First press result in the red light fades up, and the second push
            //with hold allows one to switch color to green, then blue.

            const int buttonPin = 3;    //the number of the pushbutton Pin
            const int red = 11;         //the number of the red of the RGB light Pin
            const int green = 10;       //the number of the red of the RGB light Pin
            const int blue = 9;         //the number of the red of the RGB light Pin
            int counter = 0;            //the number of times one pushes the button

            void setup() {
              // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
              pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);

              // initialize the LED pin as an output:
              pinMode(red, OUTPUT);
              pinMode(green, OUTPUT);
              pinMode(blue, OUTPUT);
            }

            void loop() {
              int buttonState;                        //variable for reading the pushbutton status
              buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);   //read the state of the pushbutton value

              //check if the button is pressed
              if (buttonState == HIGH) {        //if the button is pressed
                counter++;                      //then the number of times one pushes the button adds up
                delay(500);                     //there is a 50 ms pause to distinguish the light change
              }

              else if (counter == 0) {          //if the button is not pressed
                digitalWrite(red, LOW);         //then the RGB light doesn't light up
                digitalWrite(green, LOW);
                digitalWrite(blue, LOW);
              }

              else if (counter == 1) {          //if the button has been pressed once
                digitalWrite(green, LOW);       //then neither green light nor blue light lights up
                digitalWrite(blue, LOW);

                //red light ligths up graudally
                for(int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
                  analogWrite(red, brightness); //set red to the desire brightness
                  delay(5);                     //there is a 5 ms pause to ensure we see the change in light
                }
              }

              else if (counter == 2) {        //if the button has been pressed twice
                digitalWrite(red, LOW);       //then the green light lights up
                digitalWrite(green, HIGH);
                digitalWrite(blue, LOW);
              }

              else if (counter == 3) {      //if the button has been pressed three times
                digitalWrite(red, LOW);     //then the blue light lights up
                digitalWrite(green, LOW);
                digitalWrite(blue, HIGH);
              }

              else {                        //otherwise, we reset the counter
                counter = 0;
              }
            }
          </pre>
