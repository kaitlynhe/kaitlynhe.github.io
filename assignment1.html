            <h1>Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for Assignment 1!
            <h3>The Schematic</h3>

            This drawing is the schematic of a white LED light, a red LED light and a blue LED light.
            Resisters are picked from the calculations above.
            <h3>The Circuit</h3>
            <img src= "circuit.JPG" alt= "Picture of the Circuit I created" width=400></a>
            This is the final set up for the circuit looping from pin10, pin11, pin12 to GND.

            <h3>The Code</h3>
            <pre>

              // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
              int pin12 = 12;
              int pin11 = 11;
              int pin10 = 10;

              void setup() {
                // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
                pinMode(pin12, OUTPUT);
                pinMode(pin11, OUTPUT);
                pinMode(pin10, OUTPUT);
              }

              // the loop function runs over and over again forever
              void loop() {
                digitalWrite(pin12, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
                delay(500);                       // wait for half of a second
                digitalWrite(pin12, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
                delay(500);                       // wait for half of a second

                digitalWrite(pin11, LOW);   // turn the LED off (LOW is the voltage level)
                delay(500);                       // wait for half of a second
                digitalWrite(pin11, HIGH);    // turn the LED onn by making the voltage HIGH
                delay(500);                       //wait for half of a second

                digitalWrite(pin10, LOW);   // turn the LED off (LOW is the voltage level)
                delay(500);                       // wait for half of a second
                digitalWrite(pin10, HIGH);    // turn the LED on by making the voltage HIGH
                delay(500);                       // wait for half of a second
              }
            </pre>

            <h3>The Operation of the Circuit</h3>
            Below is a short demo of the circuit in operation.
